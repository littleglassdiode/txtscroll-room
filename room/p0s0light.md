Room
====

You are standing in the middle of a well-lit room.  There is a light switch on
one wall, which as you just discovered, seems to control an ambient glow with
no obvious source.  There is a copper pipe with a funneled end sticking down
from the ceiling.  There is no obvious way into or out of the room.
