Room
====

You are lying on the floor of the room.  You don't know why you keep doing
this.  It really isn't a comfortable floor.  The floor in your bedroom back
home, though, that's a different story.  You've slept many a night on that
floor, and no floor you've ever felt really compared to it.  The rug was soft,
not scratchy, and it was padded well enough that it was almost like a thin
mattress.  And if you ever felt hot on a summer night, the floor would cool you
off.  You really wish you were on that floor and not this one.  You also don't
know why you started referring to it in the past tense.  You have no reason to
believe anything has happened to your house or its floor.

You get up, and you don't plan to lie down here anymore.  As you get up,
something falls out of your pocket.
