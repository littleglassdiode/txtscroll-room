From the tube you hear the words:

`"Yeah, I have two in here.  The guy through my other tube says he has four,
and that two of his just lead to each other.  I don't know why we're connected
in such weird ways."`

A bit after she finishes talking, the ambient glow starts flashing rapidly red
and blue.  You find it...transfixing.
