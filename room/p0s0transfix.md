Flashing Room
=============

You would get back to your conversation if it wasn't for this flashing.  It's
just so transfixing.  Seriously, if you could see yourself right now, you'd say
something like `"Wow, that guy right there is pretty darned transfixed."`.  You
can't see yourself, though, and even if you could, I guess you'd be too
transfixed to articulate a sentence like that.

The flashing gets slightly slower.  You fall asleep.
