#   Room Game page 6
# ====================

|=Room=|

You shout into the pipe.  Apparently, there is someone at the other end, and
he/she/it starts shouting back to you through the pipe.  He/she/it shouts:
"Hello there!  I see you got into a room!"
You begin to think it's a female voice.

@007.txts:Shout "Yes, do you know how I can get out?"
@004.txts:Ignore the voice and go back to your switch-flipping down-lying game
