Room
====

You awaken from a deep sleep.  It was a good sleep, lots of nice dreams.
Except of course for that one in which you were killed repeatedly by a mutant
ape.

You are standing in the middle of a well-lit room.  There is a light switch on
one wall, which as you just discovered, seems to control an ambient glow with
no obvious source.  There is a copper pipe with a funneled end sticking down
from the ceiling.  On the other side of the room is another pipe, similar in
shape, but made of steel.  There is no obvious way into or out of the room.
You think to yourself:

`"Hey, she said that people get put in here when they find out about the rooms.
I didn't know anything about them.  Why am I here?  ..."`

Your mind wanders again when you start focusing on the word "ON" written on
the light switch.
