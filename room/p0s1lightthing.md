Whoever put you here sure didn't mind you keeping your trusty metalworking kit
on hand.  You begin planning all the things you'll do with those two pipes as
you slowly open the lid...

Empty.  Really?  They let you have the box but none of its contents?  The saw
you can understand, but the pliers?  What harm could those do?  And a small
roll of wire couldn't possibly help you escape.  You definitely admit, however,
that the miniature hammer would end up being used as a weapon, and that you'd
make a complete fool of yourself if it hadn't been taken away.  You feel glad
that that particular tool is missing, honestly.

You open the false bottom, expecting the worst.  Much to your surprise, though,
the metal polish is still inside.
