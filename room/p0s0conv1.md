Room
====

You shout into the pipe.  Apparently, there is someone at the other end, and
he/she/it starts shouting back to you through the pipe.  He/she/it shouts:

`"Hello there! I see you got into a room!"`

You begin to think it's a female voice.

* [Shout `"Yes, do you know how I can get out?"`](p0s0conv2.html)
* [Ignore the voice and go back to your switch-flipping down-lying game](p0s0light.html)
