|=Room=|

You are standing in the middle of a well-lit room.  There is a light switch on
one wall.  The room seems to glow without any obvious source of light.  There
is a copper pipe with a funneled end sticking down from the ceiling.  There is
no obvious way into or out of the room.

@001.txts:Flip the switch
@006.txts:Shout into the pipe
@005.txts:Lie down
